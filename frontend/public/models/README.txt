IMPORTANT: Your 3D model file is missing

Your application is looking for an encrypted 3D model file named "character.enc" in this directory.

Please place your encrypted model file here with the name "character.enc" for your 3D character to load properly.

If you don't have this file, you'll need to either:
1. Create/obtain the encrypted model file
2. Modify your code in src/components/character/utils/character.ts to use a different model file
